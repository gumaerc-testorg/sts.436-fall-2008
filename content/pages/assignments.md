There are two writing assignments: a review of a book from a supplied list (due in class session #5), and a research paper (25-35 double-spaced pages, due in class session #8).

Book Review
-----------

For the book review, you should select one of the following books and write a brief review (4-5 double-spaced pages). To prepare for your review, you should look at recent book reviews (of any book) in journals such as _Isis_, _Technology and Culture_, _British Journal for the History of Science_, _Annals of Science_, _Metascience_, and so on: how do those reviews balance summary of the book in question with description of how the book fits into the larger literature and critique of the book's argument?
